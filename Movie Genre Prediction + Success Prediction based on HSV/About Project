1. Predicting genre of movie using deep learning based on the movie poster images. As part of the project, I was exploring on ResNet50. 

2. Gauge whether the movie will be successful based on the movie poster image. I was in particular extracting HSV features from the poster images to determine if the movie will be successful using logistic regression.
